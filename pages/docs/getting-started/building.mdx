# Building FOSSBilling

Building FOSSBilling from the source code is rather simple and only requires a few simple steps.

1. Ensure you have the following dependencies installed: `git`, `npm`, `php`, and `composer`
2. Clone the FOSSBilling repository and then move to that directory: `git clone https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling.git && cd FOSSBilling`
3. Install NPM dependencies: `npm -i`
4. Install composer dependencies: `composer install`
5. Build the front-end assets: `npm run build`
6. (_Optional_) Download the [latest translations](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/locale/releases/tag/latest) from the locale repository and extract the contents to the `src/locale` directory. Ensure you overwrite any existing files.
7. That's it, you're done! You now have a built installation of FOSSBilling under the `src` directory which can be uploaded to a web server.
